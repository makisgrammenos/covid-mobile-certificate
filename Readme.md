## Summary

This application aims to make easier the access and verification of the COVID Vaccination Certificate which is issued by the Greek State.Since there is no offical app to store  the certificate in your phone you have to search the pdf file, when requested, which can be  time-consuming.<br/>
With this application you can save your vaccination certificate in your phone(like a plane boarding pass) by scanning the QR Code which is located in the upper right corner  of the pdf file. Otherwise you can find your QR Code in https://my.gov.gr. After that with a single tap you can access and show your certificate uppon request of authorities or shops.


## How it works.

Once you scan your QR code the app extracts the URL to your certificate info and sends an HTTP request to gov.gr API.After, it receives your first and last name in greek and english and stores it into memory.From this point forward every time you open the application you will see your first and last name in greek and english accompanied by a QR code which is generated by the app and can be verified using the COVID FREE GR app on playstore.
The app uses ```expo-secure-storage``` to save the certificate info into your phone.
